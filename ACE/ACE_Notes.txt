ACE_Notes
1) Solution 1: GCP ACE getting started
need of cloud platform(scailability, hight availability, durability, fault tolerant, operation expenditure)
usage of GCP-third biggest cloud platform

2) Google cloud regions and zones
Zones: its geographical location where services are accessed with low latency
region: more than 1 to 3 zones make a region to make high avaiability
multi-region: to provide low latency across the globe

3) Google compute Engine for ACE

virtual machine: providing or renting on-demand virtual server or instance to end-user and pay based on usage. 
install required software using startscript.sh or ps
internal Ip adress: to communicate virutal Machine with internal google resources(corporate network)
External IP address: to communicate with internet resources

Static Ip adress: its reserved IP address which is chargable until its released and its associated to any of VM machines for external connectivity.

Virtual Templates: creating of VM based on VM templates(list of options already selected for required type)

custom images: in case of any new softwares to be installed in hand, you can have custom machine image along with software installed.


hosting webserver in GCP virtual machine
sudo su
apt update
apt install apache2
ls /var/www/html
echo "Hello World!"
echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/html/index.html
echo $(hostname)
echo $(hostname -i)
echo "Hello World from $(hostname)"
echo "Hello World from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)"
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)" > /var/www/html/index.html
sudo service apache2 start


#!/bin/bashapt update apt -y install apache2echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html

process of installing OS patches or software when VM instance is launched is called Bootstrapping

4) Google concepts: optimizing costs and Performance in GCP

4.1: Sustained use Discounts: 
Automatic Discounts: based on usage its applied by platform(only GKE, and COmpute Engine) not E2, A2 compute type
commited use discounts: predictable usage needs(1 or 3 years)70 % machine type and GPU, GKE and computes applicable
Preemtible VM: SHort lived Cheaper(80% discount) lasts only 24 hours.
Spot VM's: latest version of Preemitble VM.but aviable more than 24 hours.
Compute Engine Billing: billed /second.
budget alert:to alert when charges exceed certain limit.
billing export:BIG query sends billing data biqquery dataset
Live migration:move instance to another host in same zones
Avaialbility Policy: migrate to another instance, stop, or automatic restart
Custom machine types:when workload provided by google are not relevant, change cores, VCPU , memory.
GPU(graphical processing unit):higher performance, higher cost,use images with GPU libraries, no live migration with GPU
